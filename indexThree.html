        <h2>why do we need function</h2>

     <p>
        Help us reduce code redundancy by allowing us to write a function once and call it multiple times. <br>
        Make code modular by allowing us to break a big file into smaller, more manageable chunks. <br>
        Provide abstraction by allowing us to use library functions without worrying about their internal work. <br>
        Allow us to analyse, design, investigate, predict, or solve various events. <br>
        Serve as a tool to better understand the world, create solutions, improve products and services, or make logical choices. <br>

        <h2>what are loop statement</h2>
